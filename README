Mica - The Mica Environment for Perl 5

This is an experimental module and in relation to its complexity there
are not enough tests available to consider it ready for general
production use, yet.

Right now the package on CPAN is a reservation for the name. I don't want
to write the documentation under this specific flag and then see the name
being taken.

Mica code will be released within 2012.
